# Atlas-Locations
App that tracks a specific distance

## The Brief

App that tracks the distance between the user current location and X amount of meters.
The app has two screens. One to track and another to show pins on the map

In order to use the app you should introduce your own api key on the manifest file.

When a location is found you can check it on a map and on a bottom sheet for more details.

There is an alternative style for the map available
